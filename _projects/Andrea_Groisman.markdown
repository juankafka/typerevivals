## Pea Pro ##
### Andrea Groisman ###
<br>
Pea Pro is display sans serif typeface inspired by the sports nutrition industry. Big ink traps and heavy weight features give it a strong character, ideal for large headings and branding applications. A variable font that will include a style without ink traps to show the contrast between healthy and unhealthy lifestyles.

<br>
Started off with translation pen sketches, and once digitized I added more weight to the letters. The ink traps got deeper and larger every week. Then I concluded not all letters needed this feature, to keep the typeface sober and not overkill the feature.
