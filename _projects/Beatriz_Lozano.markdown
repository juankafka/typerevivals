## Aguas ##
### by Beatriz Lozano ###
<br>
Aguas is an experimental variable font that shifts in width and curvature inspired by a hand painted signs that can be seen all through out Mexican food markets.
<br><br>
My first step in designing Aguas was figuring out how the typeface could move and what axis would be required. Then I went on to explore how the actual letterforms would look through hand drawing letters with a broad nib pen. Once the letters were digitized I took liberties with the forms and started developing a system.
