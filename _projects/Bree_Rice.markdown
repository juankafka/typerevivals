## Allegheny ##
### Bree Rice ###
<br>
Allegheny features letterforms inspired by vintage type previously displayed in historic Pittsburgh advertisements and signs from the late 1800's/early 1900's. The goal was to make a condensed, bold, slab serif, low contrast font to use in advertising. I specifically looked through historical city directories from the late 1800's for inspiration.

I started digging through the various city directories and historic imagery for inspiration and created a mood board. I ideated and sketched and then completely scrapped everything and started over with a narrower focus and brief. I wanted to reimagine a particular set of letterforms that I was drawn to as a bolder, updated, slab-serif. After the new direction was thought out I began sketching letterforms and have been sketching, digitizing, and refining since.
