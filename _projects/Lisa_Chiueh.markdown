## Azure ##
### by Lisa Chiueh ###
<br>
I want to create a typeface that have a breathing rhythm. Azure is inspired by ocean current over the world, which it carry on with the movement of waves and the flow of water.
<br><br>
By playing with calligraphy brushes and pens, I found out by using the pen, the movement is just like the waves of the ocean. Therefore, I traced the ocean current around west side of Pacific Ocean (which also where Taiwan is!) Make those details became a part of my typeface.
