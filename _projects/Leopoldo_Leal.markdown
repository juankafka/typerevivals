Labor is a text typeface with long and sharp serifs. The project was based on the Ronaldson typeface, designed by Alexander Kay and originally published by MacKellar, Smiths & Jordan in 1884. The sharp and long serifs are so unique and reminds the work tools that presents the idea of making is thinking.

The starting point of this type revival project was the Typeface Elzevir Novo, from the Henrique Rosa Type Foundry's catalog (circa) 1907â€“1913, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Comparing the sources was identified that typeface in this catalog was a Ronaldson and not an Elzevir Novo. Unfortunately isn't possible to know if the foundry bought the license or just copied the typeface and changed the name.
