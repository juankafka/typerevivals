Dang is a typographic system with latin characters and dingbats, initially inspired from the often busy, loud and graphic hand painted signage found on the streets of India.
 
Through its various iterations it has become more of an exercise for me to let loose and focus on the form of the letters, trying to create a rhythm, movement and flow. 

Dang embraces the chaos, right from its idea and initial sketches to digitising and experimenting with the letterforms.

<br>
While my initial brief was vast, experimenting with various type cooker recipes helped me narrow down the parameters I wanted to work with. There was an initial gap between sketching out the letters and digitising them. 

I went back to the drawing board a few times before I could actually digitise the letters to the way I wanted them to be. I am learning how to balance the organic flowy-ness of the sketches with the rigidity of digitising the letters.
