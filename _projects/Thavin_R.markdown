## TT-Turf-C ##
### by Thavin R. ###
<br>
TT-Turf-C is a display typeface pulling inspiration from arm/wrists movements in different dance styles such as Turfing (Oakland) and Khmer Apsaras (Cambodia). One being rooted by cultural heritage, and one rooted from where I grew up. Calligraphy has always been my main tool for lettering so it was natural for me to gravitate towards that as the base to my letterforms. Wanting to incorporate some of the squarish spaces that you see in between the elbows, I had to widen the characters a bit which made it look more contemporary.
<br><br>
Always going back to hand-writing, some things just doesn't translate well technically, so I gotta use what my hand knows the best organically or intuitively.
