Inspired by vernacular signage in Bolivia, SILPANCHO is a contemporary display typeface, which aims to be used for food menus and other local shops that keep the sense of a street nature, strong voice, and some mechanical look. My design process involved a lot of observation, calligraphy proofs and a valuable constant review to the basics of type design. It was an amazing learning journey.
