Slabra is a bold slab-serif typeface that takes a fresh look at the idiosyncratic contrast found in early type design. 

Designed primarily for display use, its narrow proportions, graphic slabs and tight spacing makes for an offbeat choice for wordmarks and headlines.

The typeface continues to be developed further to increase language support and is planned to be released in 2021.
