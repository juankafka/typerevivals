## Campo ##
### by Natalia Sálomon ###
<br>
Campo is a display typeface made for cutting floating letterforms for signage in a garden.
<br><br>
Campo was drafted on paper with a half-inch wood bookmark as basis for stems and a 6-inch x-height. The character set of lowercase and uppercase letterforms maintained this ratio in digitization. The result is a typeface that can be easily cut in wood or cardboard with a router or by hand.
