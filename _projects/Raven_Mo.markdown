## Unaware ##
### by Raven Mo ###
<br>
Unaware is an experimental display font. It is self-obsessed, rebellious and unsettling.
<br><br>
At the start of the class, I was intrigued by the idea of a font that maximizes the individuality of each character, yet still looks cohesive when used in a headline. Therefore, I decided to make a font that resembles the look of anglerfish, a species that is portrayed with such a chaotic and irrational character, yet completely unaware of it.
