## Jellyfish ##
### by Kenta Yoshioka ###
<br>
My initial brief was to create typeface that is fun and loud which fits well in music related flyers, posters and cover-arts. I think there are much more possibilities this typeface can be applied for, hoping to make people smile. I named the typeface "Jellyfish" after its chubby round shape.
<br><br>
I had a challenge of making letters heavy as possible while been careful keeping its look clean and in-style. The process of creating Jellyfish was very joyful experience.
