## Cemita ##
### by Miguel Angel Contreras Cruz ###
<br>
Cemita poblana: it’s like a powerful and magical sandwich from Puebla, my city. Is filled with breaded chicken, pork or beef (Milanesa), as well as avocado, quesillo (cheese) and chipotle (smoked and dried jalapeño chili pepper). It is full of flavors!
<br><br>
Cemita is a mexican display typeface inspired by traditional food from Puebla.
<br><br>
<b>Cemita Milanesa</b> is a sans fat face with convex forms, the milanesa is a breaded steak.
<br><br>
<b>Cemita Quesillo</b> is a script inspired by traditional cheese from Oaxaca, the quesillo is like a big rope rolled in ball shape.
<br><br>
Milanesa and quesillo are ingredients that make the perfect cemita.
