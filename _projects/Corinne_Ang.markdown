## Trickle ##
### Corinne Ang ###
<br>
Trickle is a bastardisation of the italic form. The simple aim of it was to create a vivacious, lively rhythmic display typeface that utilised the calligraphic italic ductus as a jumping point. With high contrast and strange weight placement Trickle is only suitable for large sizes while wavering on the edge of legible words and pattern.

<br>
The road to making trickle was an exploration into pure formal manipulation. What if you took a simple skeletal structure and applied a singular rule that completely messed with the whole rhythm of the typeface. Trickle did just this with a whole lot of experimentation, sketching and rule making & breaking.
