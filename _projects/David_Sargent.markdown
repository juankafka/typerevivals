Fox & Beeler Cloister is my revival of “Cloister”, a single-weight, low contrast Latin typeface distributed by Reed & Fox in London from 1874 to 1899. The original uppercase and numerals were designed for display use and were drawn by Charles H. Beeler Jr. for MacKellar, Smiths & Jordan in Philadelphia, 1873. The designer of the unauthorised lowercase is unknown but is likely to be Benjamin Fox.

As part of the revival process, diacritics and other special characters for additional language support were added. This expansion of the character set allows the typeface to be applied to more languages than the original designers could have ever imagined.
