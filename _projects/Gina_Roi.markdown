Vittoria Manuale means “Manual Victory” (in google translate Italian) and this typeface was just that for me! The revival is based off of a New York City type foundry, Bruce’s Son & co’s #20. I found a book printed in 1901 at a bookstore called “Come fu Educato Vittorio Emanuale III” about how the last King of Italy was educated. I have a much bigger appreciation for text typefaces that I didn’t expect. There are patterns and harmonies between letters I never noticed before and I’m excited to discover even more.

My research began online and then I decided to find a source in person. For my first typeface, this was super useful to have a whole book of my specimen, especially to observe spacing and punctuation. I experimented with Glyph Collector, traced over the letterforms of some words from the book, and used a magnifying glass to get to know each form.
