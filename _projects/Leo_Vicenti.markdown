My goal for this project was to create a pan-indigenous typeface that supported our Jicarilla Apache language revitalization efforts. After initial creative directions the project manifested as a display typeface created for road signage applications.

The low expansion model was inspired by writing using a "shoe" style broad nib dip pen.
