Béshí is a revival of Oldrich Menhart's copyrighted typeface, Parlament (1950-1951). My goal in this project was to offer language support for my indigenous Jicarilla Apache language. Inspiration for this project was taken from Menhart's unique style and use of diacritics.
<br><br>
My research entailed looking through multiple historical resources, utilizing comparative texts, searching for clues in social media and lots of drawing and printing.
