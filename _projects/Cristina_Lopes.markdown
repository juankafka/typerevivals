<br>
Geometricae is a geometric typeface with an Art Deco flair. It’s simple: geometric. It’s playful: it aims to be a stencil. It’s ambitious: it dreams of being a variable colored stencil font.

The uppercase set was used to define the aesthetics of the typeface. Yet, both uppercase and lowercase characters were developed at the same time, following the workshop’s workflow. The stencil version and remaining features will be fully developed after completing both uppercase and lowercase further revision and refinement.
