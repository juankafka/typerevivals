Eichenauer is a German-influenced Roman text face designed in 1955 by Warren Chappell of Richmond, Virginia. This revival attempts to capture Chappell’s original drawings as faithfully as possible, while still optimizing the design for readability and evenness at small sizes. The typeface is unique for its routed-out, or sanded appearance, which comes from Chappell’s close collaboration with master engraver and punchcutter Gustav Eichenauer, for whom the design is named.
