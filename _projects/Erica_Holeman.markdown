## Overhead ##
### by Erica Holeman ###
<br>
Overhead is a typographic manifestation of toxic work environments & their mental toll. The weighty serifs, incised stems, and exaggerated contrast all allude to the effects of immense pressure. The resulting forms are surprisingly versatile, joyful and irreverent. 
<br><br>
This typeface began with simple geometric forms and limited angles, with additional bends and breaks added in the long journey toward a warmer design.
