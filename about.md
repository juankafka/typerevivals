<br><br><br>
Recreating a historical typeface is a great teaching tool for learning type design. In the first term of Type West Online, we approach revivals as a kind of ‚Äúchoose-your-own-adventure‚Äù assignment for learning the foundations of designing type.

Over a period of ten weeks, twenty-two students from all over the world have been diligently researching, studying, and digitizing text typefaces that‚Äîin most cases‚Äîhaven‚Äôt been digitized before. 

This showcase reveals some of the process behind reviving type and celebrates the work of our students. We hope you enjoy the showcase and fall in love with the letterforms.
